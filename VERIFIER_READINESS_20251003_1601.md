# Gate2 Readiness Verification -- 2025-10-03 16:01

| Section | Status | Evidence | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | PASS | `gh pr view 192` -> MERGED 123252a; `git log origin/main` shows 123252a; `.github/workflows/gate24h_main.yml` parses clean (`python -c yaml.safe_load`); post-run steps located (lines 306/319/364/470); inline PowerShell enforces paper broker env (lines 258-266) and run metadata writer keeps simulation mirrored to config (`RunInitializer.cs:39`) with defaults disabled (`TelemetryConfig.cs:19`, `SimulationConfig` default false line 268). | Branch checkout blocked by untracked files; verified directly against `origin/main`. No explicit `SIM_ENABLED=false` env in workflow--relies on config default + validator check. |
| B | FAIL | Schema enforcement only checks minimal columns (`path_issues/validate_artifacts.py:16-44`) and never asserts REQUEST/ACK/FILL (no matches via `rg`); CLI crashes on Windows cp1252 unless `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` is set; wiring confirmed but orchestrator fails before reconstruction. | Tighten validator to require status + commission/spread/slippage columns and make output ASCII-safe. |
| C | FAIL | Risk snapshots omit drawdown/R_used/exposure fields (`BotG/Telemetry/RiskSnapshotPersister.cs:24`) though flush timer is 60s (`TelemetryConfig.cs:12`). | Extend persister + data source before claiming readiness. |
| D | PASS | `Get-PSDrive` shows C:81.5GB / D:218.1GB free; `dir D:\botg` lists only logs/runs; `gh run list --limit 1` reports completed push run. | Runner healthy and no sentinel stopfiles. |
| E | FAIL | `postrun_collect.ps1` aborts at `Join-Path` with empty `-Path` (runtime error reproduced); manual `reconstruct_fifo.py` and `validate_artifacts.py` succeed only after exporting `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`. | Full post-run orchestration cannot complete unattended; requires script fix plus UTF-8 console handling. |

## Outstanding Risks
- Validator gaps: orders.csv schema misses mandatory status + cost columns; risk snapshots not checked for drawdown/R_used/exposure.
- Telemetry risk persistence currently omits required columns, so even with timer the CSV fails acceptance.
- `postrun_collect.ps1` aborts before reconstruction/archive; Windows console codepage causes Python Unicode errors unless `PYTHONIOENCODING` is set.
- No explicit workflow guard for `SIM_ENABLED=false`; relies on defaults--consider adding env assertion.
