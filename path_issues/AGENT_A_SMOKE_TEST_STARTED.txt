Workflow: gate24h.yml
Run ID: 18378165951
URL: https://github.com/baosang12/BotG/actions/runs/18378165951

Parameters:
  - hours: 0.25 (15 minutes)

  - mode: paper

Expected Duration: ~18-20 minutes (15m run + 3-5m postrun)

Status: IN_PROGRESS
Started: 2025-10-09 20:35:05

 VALIDATION TARGETS
---------------------
Will verify in artifacts:

1. risk_snapshots.csv schema:
    Has columns: timestamp_utc, equity, balance, open_pnl, closed_pnl

2. open_pnl calculation:
   Formula: open_pnl = equity - balance
   Expected: Non-zero when positions open

3. closed_pnl accumulation:
   Formula: closed_pnl = Σ(pnl_account_ccy) from ClosedTradesWriter
   Expected: Increases on each trade close
   Expected final value: 265.67 (based on previous test runs)

4. Thread safety:
   Expected: No data races in _closedPnl updates
   Indicator: closed_pnl matches sum of closed_trades_fifo.csv


   Đợi ~18-20 phút để test hoàn tất...
