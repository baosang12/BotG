## What
- All 17 workflows (excluding gate24h*) list 31 jobs and each job now records `timeout-minutes` (see timeouts_matrix.csv; missing_timeouts.txt empty).
- Every `actions/setup-python` reference resolves to `v5` across CI/smoke workflows (python_versions.txt).
- Phase 2b hardening still intact: upload guards retain `if: always()`, workflows remain ASCII without BOM, and smoke-fast-on-pr cancellations observed via runs 18485911555 → 18485913995.

## So What
- Timeout coverage prevents runaway jobs and stabilises CI execution windows for ops teams.
- Upgrading setup-python@v5 keeps runners aligned with GitHub support policy and removes deprecation risk.
- Guard, BOM, and concurrency proofs ensure artifact upload telemetry stays available even under cancel/fail scenarios.

## Next
- Monitor smoke-fast-on-pr for 24h to watch for unexpected timeouts introduced by stricter limits.
- Fold the updated timeout matrix into ops runbooks to guide future workflow additions.
- Retire temporary verify branches (`ci/verify-phase3-*`) once reports are archived.

**VERDICT: READY**
